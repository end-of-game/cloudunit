== What is CloudUnit
CloudUnit is an open source PaaS based on docker to automating build and deployment of your java application. Cloudunit can deploy all java application type and it is a RESTful application. CloudUnit includes a list of useful services like Elasticsearch, MondoDB, Postgresql, etc. Deployment can be on CLI or Web view.
You can also install CloudUnit on a server. If you want to install ClodUnit to a server, you have some requirements.


== Getting started
Picking the right solution can help you get a CloudUnit application up and running, either for local development. Setting Up / Delpoying CloudUnit Applications
Go to: https://cu01.cloudunit.io to begin.

=== Logging
Logging is composed by *<Username>* and *<Password>*. If you want to use private CloudUnit PaaS, you must contact Treeptik to open an account.

Let's begging...
This sample is for public user in order to test CloudUnit. This <id> is not a root user so your privileged is restricted. To have root account you must create new account given by Treeptik.

 Username: johndoe
 Password: abc2015
 > login

=== Create first application
The first step is to create an application base on java application. First, choose application server and giving a name. Let's  run a sample jsp page by .war file via CloudUnit. To make that, we need a Apache tomcat serveur in our application.

.create Apache Tomcat server:
----

*App Name*: testTomcat // <1>
*App Server*: Tomcat 8.0.39 // <2>
*'Create new application'*. // <3>

----
<1> name given for your application
<2> list of available server
<3> button create

'''

image::./img/testTomcat_1.jpg[align= center]

=== Manage application
Manage application gives ability to the user to add modules, deploy applications, explore services, check logs, monitoring, setting jvm configuration, variables environments, associate volumes, run commands.
The application that you create can be attached with anoter services call *module*.

.Manage server application and add module:
----

1. App Name: testTomcat // <1>
2. choose Manage // <2>

----
<1> give it a name, here the sample name is testTomcat
<2> Validate *'MANAGE'*
