########################## Metricbeat Configuration ###########################

# This file is a full configuration example documenting all non-deprecated
# options in comments. For a shorter configuration example, that contains only
# the most common options, please see metricbeat.yml in the same directory.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:

  # Host DSN should be defined as "user:pass@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/"
  # The username and password can either be set in the DSN or using the username
  # and password config options. Those specified in the DSN take precedence.
  hosts: ["tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/"]

  # Username of hosts. Empty by default.
  username: monitoring

  # Password of hosts. Empty by default.
  password: monitoring

  # By setting raw to true, all raw fields from the status metricset will be added to the event.
  #raw: false

#================================ Outputs ======================================

  #enabled: true

  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 9200)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:9200/path

  #parameters:
    #param1: value1
    #param2: value2

  # Optional ingest node pipeline. By default no pipeline will be used.
  #pipeline: ""

  # Optional HTTP Path
  #path: "/elasticsearch"

  # Proxy server url
  #proxy_url: http://proxy:3128

  # The number of times a particular Elasticsearch index operation is attempted. If
  # the indexing operation doesn't succeed after this many retries, the events are
  # dropped. The default is 3.
  #max_retries: 3

  # The maximum number of events to bulk in a single Elasticsearch bulk API index request.
  # The default is 50.
  #bulk_max_size: 50

  # Configure http request timeout before failing an request to Elasticsearch.
  #timeout: 90

  # The number of seconds to wait for new events between two bulk API index requests.
  # If `bulk_max_size` is reached before this interval expires, addition bulk index
  # requests are made.
  #flush_interval: 1s

  # A template is used to set the mapping in Elasticsearch
  # By default template loading is enabled and the template is loaded.
  # These settings can be adjusted to load your own template or overwrite existing ones.

  # Set to false to disable template loading.
  #template.enabled: true

  # Template name. By default the template name is metricbeat.
  #template.name: "metricbeat"

  # Path to template file
  #template.path: "${path.config}/metricbeat.template.json"

  # Overwrite existing template
  #template.overwrite: false

  # If set to true, metricbeat checks the Elasticsearch version at connect time, and if it
  # is 2.x, it loads the file specified by the template.versions.2x.path setting. The
  # default is true.
  #template.versions.2x.enabled: true

  # Path to the Elasticsearch 2.x version of the template file.
  #template.versions.2x.path: "${path.config}/metricbeat.template-es2x.json"

  # Use SSL settings for HTTPS. Default is true.
  #ssl.enabled: true

  # Configure SSL verification mode. If `none` is configured, all server hosts
  # and certificates will be accepted. In this mode, SSL based connections are
  # susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Use only for testing. Default is
  # `full`.
  #ssl.verification_mode: full

  # List of supported/valid TLS versions. By default all TLS versions 1.0 up to
  # 1.2 are enabled.
  #ssl.supported_protocols: [TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2]

  # SSL configuration. By default is off.
  # List of root certificates for HTTPS server verifications
  #ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"]

  # Configure cipher suites to be used for SSL connections
  #ssl.cipher_suites: []

  # Configure curve types for ECDHE based cipher suites
  #ssl.curve_types: []

#================================ Logging ======================================
# There are three options for the log output: syslog, file, stderr.
# Under Windows systems, the log files are per default sent to the file output,
# under all other system per default to syslog.

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: critical, error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: info

# Enable debug output for selected components. To enable all selectors use ["*"]
# Other available selectors are "beat", "publish", "service"
# Multiple selectors can be chained.
#logging.selectors: [ ]

# Send all logging output to syslog. The default is false.
#logging.to_syslog: true

# If enabled, metricbeat periodically logs its internal metrics that have changed
# in the last period. For each metric that changed, the delta from the value at
# the beginning of the period is logged. Also, the total values for
# all non-zero internal metrics are logged on shutdown. The default is true.
#logging.metrics.enabled: true

# The period after which to log the internal metrics. The default is 30s.
#logging.metrics.period: 30s

# Logging to rotating files files. Set logging.to_files to false to disable logging to
# files.
logging.to_files: true
logging.files:
  # Configure the path where the logs are written. The default is the logs directory
  # under the home path (the binary location).
  path: /opt/cloudunit/polling-agents/metricbeat

  # The name of the files where the logs are written to.
  name: metricbeat

  # Configure log file size limit. If limit is reached, log file will be
  # automatically rotated
  #rotateeverybytes: 10485760 # = 10MB

  # Number of rotated log files to keep. Oldest files will be deleted first.
  #keepfiles: 7
